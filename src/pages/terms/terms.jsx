        These terms and conditions apply to the Quilly app for web br /owsers,
        together with any related services operated by Omar Zeini (collectively,
        the "Application"). Omar Zeini is hereby referred to as the "Service
        Provider".
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        By downloading or using the Application, you agree to these Terms and
        Conditions. You should read them carefully before using the Application.

      <div>
        <strong>License to use the Application</strong>
        <p>
          Subject to your compliance with these Terms, the Service Provider
          grants you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable
          license to install and use the Application on a computer for personal
          or internal business purposes. You may not reproduce, distribute,
          modify, create derivative works from, reverse engineer, decompile, or
          disassemble the Application, except as and only to the extent that
          such activity is expressly permitted by applicable law.
        </p>
      </div>
      <br />
      <strong>Intellectual Property</strong>
      <p>
        The Service Provider retains all intellectual property rights in the
        Application, including its code, design, trademarks, service marks,
        trade names, logos, and br /anding (the "IP"). Nothing in these Terms
        grants you any license or right to use the Service Provider's
        trademarks, logos, or br /anding for any purpose. You agree not to
        remove, alter, or obscure any copyright, trademark, or other proprietary
        notices displayed in or on the Application.
      </p>
      <br />
      <strong>Termination</strong>
      <p>
        The Service Provider may suspend your access to the Application or
        services if you materially br /each these Terms. The Service Provider
        will provide you with written notice of the br /each and, where the br
        /each is capable of cure, you will have 14 days from receipt of notice
        to remedy the br /each. If you fail to cure the br /each within that
        period, the Service Provider may terminate your access.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        The Service Provider may suspend or terminate your access immediately
        without notice if you violate applicable law, infringe intellectual
        property rights, or engage in activity that could cause harm to other
        users or the Service Provider.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Upon termination, your right to use the Application will end and you
        must delete all copies from your devices.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        By accessing and using this Application, you represent that you are
        legally permitted to use it in your jurisdiction. You must be at least
        16 years of age (the age of digital consent in your jurisdiction) to use
        the Application. If you are below 16, a parent or legal guardian must
        review and accept these Terms on your behalf.
      </p>
      <div>
        <br />
        <p>
          Unauthorized copying, modification of the Application, any part of the
          Application, or the Service Provider's trademarks is strictly
          prohibited. Any attempts to extract the source code of the
          Application, translate the Application into other languages, or create
          derivative versions are not permitted. All trademarks, copyrights,
          database rights, and other intellectual property rights related to the
          Application remain the property of the Service Provider.

      <p>You agree not to post content that:</p>

        </li>
      </ul>
      <br />
      <p>The Service Provider reserves the right to:</p>

          Remove or disable access to content that violates these guidelines
        </li>

      </ul>
      <br />
      <p>
        Content submitted through the Application may be visible to other users
        or to the public, depending on how the Application functions.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        If you believe content violates these Terms, infringes your rights, or
        is unlawful, you may report it to the Service Provider at
        omarcode77@gmail.com. The report should include enough information for
        the Service Provider to identify the content, evaluate the complaint,
        and contact you if follow-up is required.
      </p>
      <br />

      <p>
        The Service Provider may review reported content, request additional
        information where necessary, remove or restrict access to content, and
        take action against the responsible account where appropriate. Users
        affected by moderation decisions may contact the Service Provider at
        omarcode77@gmail.com to request further review. The Service Provider
        will respond to appeals within a reasonable period and provide the
        reasons for any upheld moderation decision, subject to applicable law.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        By submitting User-Generated Content you grant the Service Provider a
        non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license to use, reproduce,
        distribute, prepare derivative works of, display and perform the content
        in connection with the Application and the Service Provider's business.
        This license does not grant the Service Provider the right to sell or
        sublicense your content to third parties independently of the
        Application. You represent and warrant that you own or control all
        rights in the content you post and that use of the content does not
        violate these Terms or applicable law.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Your content may include personal data. Processing of personal data
        related to User-Generated Content is governed by the Privacy Policy. Do
        not post personal data of others without their consent.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        The Service Provider is dedicated to ensuring that the Application is as
        beneficial and efficient as possible. As such, they reserve the right to
        modify the Application or charge for their services at any time and for
        any reason. The Service Provider assures you that any charges for the
        Application or its services will be clearly communicated to you.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        The Application stores and processes personal data that you have
        provided to the Service Provider in order to provide the Service. It is
        your responsibility to maintain the security of your computer and access
        to the Application.
      </p>
      <br />
      <div>
        <p>
          Please be aware that the Service Provider does not assume
          responsibility for certain aspects. Some functions of the Application
          require an active internet connection. The Service Provider cannot be
          held responsible if the Application does not function at full capacity
          due to lack of access to the internet or if you have exhausted your
          data allowance.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          If you are using the Application, please be aware that your internet
          service provider's agreement terms still apply. Consequently, you may
          incur charges from your internet provider for data usage during the
          use of the Application. By using the Application, you accept
          responsibility for any such charges.
        </p>
      </div>
      <br />
      <p>
        Similarly, the Service Provider cannot always assume responsibility for
        your usage of the application. For instance, it is your responsibility
        to ensure that your device remains charged. If your device runs out of
        battery and you are unable to access the Service, the Service Provider
        cannot be held responsible.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Nothing in these Terms shall limit any rights you have under applicable
        consumer protection laws that cannot be lawfully excluded.
      </p>
      <strong>Limitation of Liability</strong>
      <p>
        To the fullest extent permitted by law, the Service Provider shall not
        be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or
        punitive damages, including but not limited to lost profits, data loss,
        or business interruption, even if advised of the possibility of such
        damages.
      </p>
      <br />

      <p>
        To the fullest extent permitted by law, the total liability of the
        Service Provider for any claim shall not exceed the amount paid by you
        to the Service Provider for the Application in the 12 months preceding
        the claim, or the minimum amount that must be paid under applicable law,
        whichever is greater. If the Application is provided free of charge,
        this means the Service Provider's liability is limited to the minimum
        amount permitted by applicable law.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        The Service Provider accepts no liability for any loss, direct or
        indirect, that you experience as a result of relying entirely on
        third-party information provided through this Application, or for
        inaccuracies in content provided by third parties.
      </p>
      <br />
      <strong>Indemnification</strong>
      <p>
        To the fullest extent permitted by law, you agree to indemnify and hold
        harmless the Service Provider, its affiliates, officers, directors,
        employees and agents from and against any claims, liabilities, damages,
        losses and expenses, including reasonable legal fees, arising out of or
        directly related to your breach of these Terms or your intentional
        misuse of the Application, including User-Generated Content you submit
        in violation of these Terms.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        This indemnification does not apply to claims arising from the Service
        Provider's own negligence, breach of these Terms, or violation of
        applicable law. In jurisdictions where consumer indemnification is
        restricted by law, this clause shall be limited to the maximum extent
        permitted.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        The Service Provider may wish to update the application at some point.
        The application is currently available as per the requirements for the
        operating system (and for any additional systems they decide to extend
        the availability of the application to) may change, and you will need to
        download the updates if you want to continue using the application. The
        Service Provider does not guarantee that it will always update the
        application so that it is relevant to you and/or compatible with the
        particular operating system version installed on your device. You should
        accept updates when offered; if you choose not to, the Service Provider
        may cease to support earlier versions and the Application may not
        function properly. The Service Provider may also wish to cease providing
        the application and may terminate its use at any time without providing
        termination notice to you. Unless they inform you otherwise, upon any
        termination, (a) the rights and licenses granted to you in these terms
        will end; (b) you must cease using the application, and (if necessary)
        delete it from your device.
      </p>
      <br />
      <strong>Governing Law and Jurisdiction</strong>
      <br />
      <p>
        These Terms and Conditions are governed by the laws of the jurisdiction
        in which the Service Provider is established, excluding conflict of law
        rules, except to the extent mandatory consumer protection laws provide
        otherwise.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Any dispute arising out of or relating to these Terms will be brought
        before the courts that have jurisdiction under applicable law. Nothing
        in this clause limits any rights you may have to bring a claim in a
        court that is competent under mandatory law.
      </p>
      <br />
      
      <strong>Severability</strong>
      <p>
        If any provision of these Terms and Conditions is held to be invalid,
        illegal, or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, such
        provision shall be modified to the minimum extent necessary to make it
        valid and enforceable, and the remaining provisions of these Terms shall
        remain in full force and effect.
      </p>
      <br />
      <strong>Entire Agreement</strong>
      <p>
        These Terms and Conditions, together with the Privacy Policy, constitute
        the entire agreement between you and the Service Provider concerning
        your use of the Application, superseding any prior agreements or
        understandings.
      </p>
      <br />
